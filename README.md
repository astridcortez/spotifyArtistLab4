# spotifyArtistLab4
The program titled SpotifyArtistLab4, is much like SpotifyArtistLab3 with a couple changes. It is meant to take in multiple csv files that contain a list of records: song rank, song title, name of artist, streams, and the url, and combines all the files into one, putting them in an ordered. In order to do that, the program takes in the csv file, splits the information into an array with 5 rows and 2400 collumns and prints it out which is one method. Once we have the array with the song artists, the number of times they show up, and the length of this array, another method takes this, organizes it alphabetically and puts it into another array. For the end result we have an alphabetized array by song name. Where this differs from SpotifyArtistLab4 is that once the songs are in ascending order, they are two saparate ways in which the array of songs is organized. They is something called a queue where the songs are placed to play next and whatever song was placed in first will be first taken out and played, and a second list where it keeps track of what song aws just played.
